                        <p>Silviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health,
                            and quality of forests to meet diverse needs and values. The main aim of silviculture is
                            regeneration of forest stands. The study of silviculture enables the foresters to know the
                            whole course of natural succession on a given site and also the manner and the speed of
                            existing crop being replaced or altered. Agroforestry is the intentional integration of
                            trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems to create sustainable land use
                            management system which is environmentally sound, economically feasible and socially
                            acceptable in farming society.</p>
                        <p>Realizing the importance of forestry education the Forest College and Research Institute,
                            Mulugu started Department of Silviculture and Agroforestry on 3rd August, 2016 and
                            introduced undergraduate and postgraduate forestry courses with a prime objective of
                            promoting education, research and extension in the field of Silviculture and Agroforestry.

                        <p><strong>Mission:</strong></p>
                        <p>Telangana state is blessed with rich biodiversity and wildlife forms are an important part of it.
                            For the protection and conservation of wildlife, various protected areas are established in
                            the state. Habitat fragmentation and degradation are the major issues in the conservation of
                            wildlife. Natural resources are facing enormous pressure, resulting in the
                            decline of wildlife over the years, with many more species being threatened with extinction. Deep
                            knowledge of the different components of the ecology of species and its habitat is needed to
                            address conservation issues. So, the department of Wildlife is established with a view to
                            provide appropriate human resources, who can assist the State forest department in conservation and management of
                            wildlife. Research is focused on animal population
                            ecology, behavioural ecology, community ecology, trophic interactions, conservation
                            genetics, methods for monitoring animal populations, systematic, prey density analysis,
                            biodiversity studies and wildlife â€“ human interface issues etc.</p>

                        <p>The major objective of this Department is to provide high quality education to students in
                            order to strengthen and deepen their understanding of ecological and environmental problems.
                            Ecology and environment is a wide field that encompasses all life forms and its surroundings
                            on the Earth. It provides useful evidence on the interdependence between people and the natural
                            world, as well as the consequences of human activity on the environment. The activities
                            under the department include regular classes on various topics, field vists to various
                            ecosystem, projects to students, hands on training, research etc. The research projects
                            under department of Forest ecology and climate science are based on topics which are of utmost
                            important in the current scenario such as climate resilient species,
                            ecology, aquatic ecology phyto-remediation, ecosystem services, urbanization impact,
                             biodiversity conservation, documentation etc. Ecology occupies an
                            increasingly important space both in the scientific and socioeconomic sphere, taking into
                            account the great challenges that arise regarding the sustainable management of natural
                            resources and the conservation and protection of natural systems. So the aim of the
                            department is to grow the sense of ecological balance through sustainable management and
                            imapct of imbalance on environment and human among students through the well designed
                            syllabus for different courses under the department.</p>

                        <p>Over the years, the visibility of Basic and Social Sciences in forestry curricula has
                            decreased. The Basic and Social Sciences, a dynamic department, strives to provide a
                            backbone to Forestry Education and to enhance the student's potentialities and make their
                            base firm for forestry and their bright future.</p>
                        <p>The department effectively supports other departments by providing quality education and
                            training in basic and social sciences. Our department is committed to prepare the future
                            forestry professionals with advanced understanding, problem solving skills, civic
                            responsibilities and communication skills.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Basic and Social Sciences (B & SS) conducts all the core courses of basic
                            and applied sciences, including Information and Communication Technology, Communication
                            Skills and Personality Development, Plant Biochemistry, Forest Botany/Basic Mathematics,
                            Physical Education, NCC/NSS, Statistical Methods & Experimental Design, Forest Tribology &
                            Anthropology, Forest Extension & Community Forestry, Entrepreneurship Development & Business
                            Management, Forest Economics and Marketing, Agricultural Informatics, which appear in the
                            4-year B.Sc. (Honours) and M.Sc. Forestry programmes. Extensively proficient faculty members
                            of B & SS also engage in research and extension work, besides the teaching activity.</p>
                        <p>Broad areas of research are in the interdisciplinary fields of Biochemistry, computational
                            biology, Nanotechnology and Geomatics, which are supported by modern state-of-the-art
                            laboratories. The department also participates in action/applied research apart from basic
                            research which includes Technology Assessment & Refinement at field level, imparting
                            extension training to farmers and other stakeholders using modern communication tools.</p>
                        <p>Biochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. Biochemistry focuses on processes happening at a molecular level. It focuses on whatâ€™s happening inside our cells, studying components like proteins, lipids and organelles. It also looks at how cells communicate with each other, for example during growth or fighting illness. Biochemists need to understand how the structure of a molecule relates to its function, allowing them to predict how molecules will interact.It is a laboratory based science that brings together biology and chemistry. By using chemical knowledge and techniques.â€¯Biochemistry Laboratory is part of Basic and Social Sciences Department. Major activities in the lab include isolation and identification of various phytochemicals, mechanistic studies of plant metabolites and phytochemicals to understand their medicinal properties  
The lab is well equipped with extraction, purification related tools and techniques, along with other analytical equipment including Spectrophotometer, protein electrophoresis unit.</p>
